# Dual-axis-solar-tracker-with-weather-sensor


Global warming has increased the demand and request for green energy produced by renewable sources such as solar power.

 A Dual-axis tracker can increase energy by tracking sun rays from switching solar panel in various directions.  

This dual axis solar tracker project can also be used to sense weather!

# WORKING PRINCINPLE

The system is divided into four different units:
1. Sensing unit- The LDR sensors sense the light and sends signal to microcontroller.
2. Control unit- The microcontroller, according to the developed program code, processes the received information to dc servo motors.
3. Movement adjustment unit- The dc servo motors drive the solar panel in horizontal and vertical direction.
4.The weather sensing unit which indicates the surrounding temperature conditions and humidity is displayed on LCD display device.
